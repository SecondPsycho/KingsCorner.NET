    <h1>How to play King's Corner</h1>
    
    <p>
        The game is played with an ordinary deck of playing cards (Jokers removed). 
        Each turn, you draw a single card and must place it somewhere on a 4x4 grid.
    </p>
    <img src="/Images/sample_game_start.png" style="height:400px;" alt="What the game looks like, near the start" title="A board with six cards already played. Next, the player must place the 6 of Diamonds.">
    <p>
        Each card has rules about where it can be placed.
    </p>
        <li>Kings can only be placed in corners.</li>
        <li>Queens can only be placed in the leftmost and rightmost squares (But not corners).</li>
        <li>Jacks can only be placed in the top or bottom squares (again, not counting corners).</li> 
        <li>Aces and Numbered cards can be placed anywhere.</li>
    <br>
    <p>
        Once you've placed all the face cards, you win!
    </p>
    <img src="/Images/sample_game_win.png" style="height:400px;" alt="What the game looks like when you win" title="Even once you've won, you can still play and match cards.">
    <p>
        If two cards add up to 10, you can match them together and remove them from the board.
        (ex: a 3 and a 7, an ace and a nine, or two fives can be matched together.)
        (You can ignore suits.)
    </p>
    <img src="/Images/sample_game_match_example.png" style="height:400px;" alt="A visual example of matching cards" title="A 6 of Clubs matches with a 4 of Hearts, because 6 + 4 = 10.">
    <p>
        A ten can be matched with itself. Just double-click on it.
    </p>
    <img src="/Images/sample_game_match_example_ten.png" style="height:400px;" alt="A visual example of matching a ten with itself" title="Just double-click on a ten to make it disappear!">
    <p>
        If you can't find a legal move, you lose.
    </p>
    <img src="/Images/sample_game_lose.png" style="height:400px;" alt="What the game looks like when you lose" title="There's no matches to be made, and all the top and bottom tiles are taken. There's nowhere to put the Jack of Diamonds.">
    <p>
        Don't worry, though! You can always click 'Undo' as many times as you need. Or click 'New Game' to reshuffle the deck and start a new game!
    </p>
    <h2>Good Luck!</h2>
